# Huawei RDS preparation and local PostgreSQL control

ADR 0035 prepares a matched test that moves PostgreSQL from the shared backend ECS to Huawei RDS while retaining local PgBouncer and an aggregate application pool/admission budget of twelve. Cloud RDS execution is pending the private endpoint, credentials and CA bundle.

## Completed preparation

- Added `compose.rds.yaml`; default rendering excludes the local PostgreSQL service, points PgBouncer upstream at RDS with certificate verification and directs migrations straight to RDS.
- Added a credential-safe preflight for DNS, TCP, TLS, primary/read-write state, version, encoding, connection budget, latency and post-migration schema checks.
- Added a PostgreSQL statistics and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` collector plus a deterministic local/RDS comparator.
- Verified the override with placeholder values: PgBouncer and migration have no dependency on local PostgreSQL; API uses PgBouncer; local PostgreSQL appears only with the explicit `local-database` profile.

## Local control, 2026-09-12 UTC

The preflight ran against the isolated local PostgreSQL 17.6 container with its local-only plaintext exception. It passed five migration checksums, 17 required tables and nine required indexes. Median TCP, connect and read-only transaction times were 0.530 ms, 8.750 ms and 0.693 ms. TLS was false, as expected for this Docker-network control; TLS remains mandatory by default for RDS.

The idle profiler completed without mutation. The 151 MB database reported zero cumulative deadlocks. Representative PostgreSQL execution times were:

| Query | Execution time | Top node |
|---|---:|---|
| Event lookup | 0.010 ms | Index Scan |
| Seat lock | 0.090 ms | LockRows |
| Active hold owner | 0.020 ms | LockRows |
| Expiry candidate | 0.040 ms | Limit |
| Outbox pending | 0.010 ms | Limit |
| Reconciliation due | 0.190 ms | Limit |

These are idle single executions with warm buffers. Cumulative database/WAL counters predate this capture and are retained only as a baseline snapshot. They must not be compared as stage deltas. Sustained matched load and RDS service metrics will determine the capacity result.

## Regression validation

Compose structural checks passed for local-PostgreSQL exclusion, dependency removal, PgBouncer upstream certificate verification, CA mounts and runtime routing. The full suites passed: 75 unit tests and 57 integration tests, with only two existing dependency deprecation warnings per suite. Repository-wide Ruff checks passed with the known Windows Docker executable-bit rule excluded.

## Next evidence

When RDS is available, run infrastructure preflight, migrations, schema preflight and the idle comparison before starting services. Then execute the 400/500/600 RPS matched stages and proceed to 750/1,000 only while all gates pass. Full commands and failure gates are in `docs/rds-runbook.md`.
